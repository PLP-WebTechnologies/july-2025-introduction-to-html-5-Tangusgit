            <h2>How to Start🚀🎯💻</h2>
            <p>Learn hacking basics and find a platform you're comfortable with such as Kali linux.</p>
            <p>After the basics practice finding bugs in sites like Hack the Box that have been made vulnerable just for you.</p>
            <p>Once you're comfortable throw yourself into the real world and use your skills to help companies on sites like HackerOne and Intigriti.</p>

            <p>NOTE: Every hacker chooses their ending: 💻💰 Bug bounty hall of fame… or 🔥🚓 FBI most wanted.</p>
